### TODOS

1. Build better abstraction for MediaInfo: This will help me to connect to different files manager (not only device based)
2. Build better abstraction for the way I use path. For android storage, use StorageManager instead
3. Reduce the dependency on File API
4. Create a progress listener for file deletion
